                    The Protein Data Bank residence time (PDBrt) database is a free, non-commercial repository for 3D
                    protein-ligand complex data, including the measured ligand residence time inside the binding pocket of the specific biological
                    macromolecules as deposited in The Protein Data Bank. The PDBrt database contains information about both the protein
                    and the ligand separately, as well as the protein-ligand complex, binding kinetics, and time of the ligand
                    residence inside the protein binding site.

                    ligand-target residence time or dissociation rate. Only complexes with known ligand-target residence time or dissociation rate were added to the final
                    PDBrt dataset.
