# The residence time ([PDBrt](https://pdbrt.polsl.pl/)) database

The [PDBrt](https://pdbrt.polsl.pl/) database is a free, non-commercial repository for 3D protein-ligand complex data, including 
the measured ligand residence time inside the binding pocket of the specific biological macromolecules as deposited in The Protein Data Bank. The PDBrt database contains information about both the protein and the ligand separately, as well as the protein-ligand complex, binding kinetics, and time of the ligand residence inside the protein binding site.

## Availability
The [PDBrt](https://pdbrt.polsl.pl/) is available to the community through its web-based interface only. 

## What about the data?
All users have access to the database content - login is not required!

New data can be added by the authors only (database administrators), after login, either by uploading an xlsx (MS Excel) file or manually. 

Contact us, if you feel like some data is missing or you have just found a protein-ligand complex with known residence time which is not included in the PDBrt.
